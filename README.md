Vision and aim: Explainable Root Cause Analysis Engine for Enterprise Systems

Roadmap: (This is an AI assisted project and not a research paper or publication)

-- 2026-27: Build automated RCA and redeployment of complex multi-layered enterprise technology (software) systems using RCA from LLMs and redeploy using DevSecOps automation - keep human in the loop 

-- 2027-28: Include mathematics including Markov Chains → State transitions & fault propagation, Time Series Models → Trend, anomaly detection, Bayesian Inference → Probabilistic reasoning & RCA and Graph Models (GNN/Knowledge Graphs) → Dependency mapping - build analytics using this and feed into RCA after profiling the complex system 

-- 2028-29: Extrapolate to Electrical systems (grids, PLCs, SCADA), Electronics systems (embedded devices, IoT) and Technology systems (applications, microservices, cloud infra) - Generalize using above two steps 

-- 2030-31: Create a generic framework and publishable work in journals and conferences for the above

PROJECT CONTEXT
This project was started as part of the Executive Masters in Data Science for Decision Making at IIT Gandhinagar - DSDM | IITGNX in October, 2025

Status:

Change log: 

v0.9_1 – 18th April 2026 (WIP / Draft)

v0.9_2 – 21st  April 2026 (WIP / Draft) - Prompt 7 added and related section on literature review added in the end 

v0.9_3 – 21st  April 2026 (WIP / Draft) - Prompt 8 added and related section on research question / hypothesis

This is a practical project concept note and implementation plan, not a formal research paper. Will convert into a research paper and PhD thesis later (maybe as time and work progressses). 

Prompts and thinking used for proposal:

1. Generic framework and implementation template for automated debugging and redeployment for electrical, electronics & technology systems assisted by models formed by Markov Chains, Time Series, Bayesian and Graphs Expand and build a 5 page proposal, refine as necessary 

2. Give me some relevant research papers on this 

3. Give me list of important 50 concepts from mathematics, science & engineering for this research 

4. Talk to me about a crawler like Google Spider - Apache Nutch which can map and build graphs for electrical, electronic & technology systems - how will we build it, maintain, enhance it, how we will write contracts, etc. for all major systems to interface with for debugging 

5. Integrate SHODAN into this

6. Yes please do that 

7. Proposal: Generic Framework for Automated Debugging & Redeployment of Electrical,
 Electronics & Technology Systems Using Probabilistic and Graph-Based Models
Conduct literature review for above and give me top 15-25 papers on this with tentative research gaps - 3 to 4

8. Generic Framework for Automated Debugging & Redeployment of Electrical, Electronics & Technology Systems Using Probabilistic and Graph-Based Models
Frame a research question / hypothesis for the above

🚀 Automated Debugging & RCA Framework (Agentic AI)

A minimal agentic AI framework for automated debugging, root cause analysis (RCA), and evidence-driven diagnostics across:

Web applications
Infrastructure (OS + DB)
Browser-level behavior (CDP)
SSL/TLS validation
🎯 Objective

To demonstrate a working, explainable debugging system that:

Collects multi-layer evidence
Correlates signals across systems
Uses LLMs for structured RCA
Produces human-readable execution reports
